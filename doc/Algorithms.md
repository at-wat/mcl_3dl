## Algorithms

A fundamental algorithm of *mcl_3dl* node is Monte Carlo localization (MCL), aka particle filter localization.
MCL represents a probabilistic distribution of estimated pose as density and weight of particles and estimates the pose from the distribution.

### Measurement

A main aspect of the node is a combination of *beam_range_finder_model*, *likelihood_field_range_finder_model* that were well-described in the book Probabilistic Robotics, by Thrun, Burgard, and Fox.
*beam_range_finder_model* can reduce false positive matching by handling visibility of the measured point in the map.
However, *beam_range_finder_model* is heavier than *likelihood_field_range_finder_model*.

#### Model

*mcl_3dl* node uses both of them to perform good matching result and also light computation power.
The node calculates a likelihood of each particle by multiplying likelihood of *likelihood_field_range_finder_model* by using a larger number of points and one of beam_range_finder_model by using only a few random sampled points.
It realizes pointcloud matching with small computation power with rejecting matched-but-wrong matches.

In this implementation, the likelihood of *likelihood_field_range_finder_model* is a summation of distances from each measured point to closest point in the map. 
The closest point search uses Kd-tree, and the measured point is voxel filtered and random sampled to reduce computation power.

Likelihood of *beam_range_finder_model* is calculated by ray casting.
Where `N` is the number of rays of measured point, `n` is the number of the rays which passes through objects described in the map, and *alpha* is a rejection weight, likelihood is given as `alpha^(n/N)`.

#### Axis dependent distance weight

In some environments like a floor with sparse wall, e.g. temporary scaffoldã€€with guard rails, distance in Z-direction must be less cared, since the number of points to fix Z position is large.
In *mcl_3dl* node, the weight coefficient of distance calculation is changed by parameters.
For example in a scaffold based plant, `(dist_weight_x, dist_weight_y, dist_weight_z)=(1.0, 1.0, 5.0)` seems reasonable.

### Prediction

The pose of the particles is predicted according to odometry data with noise parameters.
*mcl_3dl* node does not have specified input of IMU data.
Using odometry data compensated by IMU is recommended.

### Resampling

*mcl_3dl* node resamples particles by copying particles which have large probability according to the distribution.
Copied particles is spread by the Gaussian noise.
