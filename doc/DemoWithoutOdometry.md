## Demo without odometry (very experimental)

Increasing number of the particles and noise variance enables localization without odometry.
Currently, this feature is very experimental and should be improved in the future.

Even if without odometry, *mcl_3dl* node requires `/odom` topic that has orientation from IMU.
track_odometry node in [neonavigation meta-package](https://github.com/at-wat/neonavigation), which is designed to combine wheel odometry and IMU, can generate it.

Download the example bag and run the demo with following arguments.

```.sh
# Running the demo without odometry
roslaunch mcl_3dl test.launch use_pointcloud_map:=false use_cad_map:=false \
  use_bag_file:=true bag_file:=${HOME}/Downloads/short_test.bag \
  use_neonavigation:=true without_odom:=true
```

neonavigation meta-package is required to try this.
